# Logistic Regression

Code for a custom logistic regression function, based from assignments from the Spring 2019 offering of CS289A, which can perform both batch, mini-batch, and stochastic gradient descent. For example experiments, see experiments.py. 

The dataset used for this (wine.mat) is also credited to the Spring 2019 offering of CS289A. 

# Running an experiment

To run the full set of experiments that I did, clone the repo and run:

```

python code/experiments.py

```

You can also visualize the outputs of the experiments in Jupyter Notebook in the experiments/ folder.
